# Day 7

I've used the https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/frozen[`frozen`] library for a `constexpr unordered_map` in this solution, so the include directory to said library's header files need to be specified.

The relevant header files can be found in the `include/` folder.

## How to run

`g{plus}{plus} solution.cpp -Wall -Werror -std=c{plus}{plus}20 -o solution -I include && ./solution`
